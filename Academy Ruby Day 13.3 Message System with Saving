# while loops in ruby
#   using booleans to control it
#   similar to C#
#   end in ruby is like } in C#
# arrays in ruby
#   .push to add things in (at the end)
#       << also does this (shovel operator)
#   arrays in ruby just add things in!
# can put your terminal inside of visual studio (thanks, Jinah!)
