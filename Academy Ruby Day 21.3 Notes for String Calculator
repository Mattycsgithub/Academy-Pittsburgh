string calculator:

Outside world interaction:
- create a calculator
- pass in a string 'equation' to a function
- that function should return the answer to the equation


Inside the calculator:
- function called from the outside: 'calculate'
    - take one parameter (a string) that is the equation: 'the_string'

with the_string:
- find the different parts that we care about
    - find/recognize the numbers
    - find/recognize the operators
        - .include? to see if there's a +/-/whatever
    - deal with/ignore? spaces and other characters
    - ways to do:
        - find the numbers/operators based on where they're stored in the string - array[0] is the first number
        - .split on spaces to break up the string into an array
        - .partition on operators to break up the string into an array
        - find a number at the beginning, store it in left_number, find an operator next, store it in operator, the rest is right_number
    
- do the math - return the math answer
    - I'm gonna have a left_number, operator, and right_number
    - decide which math based on what the operator is
        - if, if else...
        - public_send

This works for 2 + 2, but not for:
- 2 + 2 + 2 (or order of operations)
- negative numbers

2 + 2
- ops: 1
- array length: 3

2 + 2 + 2
- ops: 2
- array length: 5

2 + 2 + 4 + 4
- ops: 3
- array length: 7

integer division gives me the number of times i have to do operations
loop the nubmer of ops times, do addition with the right places

1+1+2+4+4
2 + 2 + 4 + 4
4 + 4 + 4
8 + 4
12

loop while there are more than 1 thing in my array
    add the first two together
    remove the first two things
    put the answer at the beginning
end
