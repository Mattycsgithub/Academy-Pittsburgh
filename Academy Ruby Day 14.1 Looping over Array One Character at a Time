# first goal: display message letter by letter

# ask for a message from the user
puts "What message would you like to have translated into Braille?"
message = gets.chomp

# letter by letter, find out the braille for each letter?
# for loop? each loop? each_char?

# position-based indexing
(0...message.length).each do |letter_position|
    puts "The letter is: #{message[letter_position]}"
end

# each_char loop
# collection-based processing
message.each_char do |letter|
    puts letter
end

# include the index!
message.each_char.with_index do |letter, position|
    puts "#{position}: #{letter}"
end

# display the braille
